SUMMARY:Open-Source Processors: Bringing Silicon Back to Silicon Valley?
UID:events_stanford_edu_79694
DESCRIPTION:\nThe open-source approach to developing new technologies is 
 entering a new \nrealm\, with the potential to change an entire industry
 . For years\, open-source \nhas lived exclusively in the software domain
 . From Linux to GitHub\, open-source \nsoftware has become a powerful wa
 y to bring new products and solutions to \nmarket. This open-source tran
 sformation in software is now making its way to \nhardware\, with far-re
 aching implications.\n\nOpen-source has the potential to be as big a gam
 e-changer in hardware as it \nhas been in software. Companies like Sifiv
 e and Esperanto are already \ncommercializing new architectures based on
  the open-source approach\, and new \nopen-source communities like the R
 ISC V consortium are having a huge impact.\n\nIn this event\, our panel 
 will discuss the promise of open-source CPU \narchitectures and the chal
 lenges faced in building complete system-on-a-chip \n(SoC) products arou
 nd an open-source core.\n\n * What will motivate chip companies and cust
 omers to embrace open-source \nhardware? \n * What ecosystem components 
 are needed for successful commercialization? \n * Which domains will ben
 efit by embedding an open-architecture? \n * What business models can su
 cceed in this new ecosystem? \n\nJoin us on September 18 to find out.\n\
 nUse code AP2018 for $5 discount on student tickets (already significant
 ly \ndiscounted)\, $10 off non-student tickets\, and 1/2 off livestream.
 \n\n\n\nPresented by VLAB in cooperation with the US-Asia Technology Man
 agement Center.\n

SUMMARY:Painting Nature in the American Gilded Age
UID:events_stanford_edu_79157
DESCRIPTION:\nDrawing from the Cantor’s permanent collection\, this exhib
 ition considers how \nnature was depicted by American artists from the 1
 880s to 1910\, an era of \nunprecedented industrialization and urban dev
 elopment. Through landscapes\, \nportraits\, and still lifes\, the exhib
 ition highlights the importance of nature \nfor artists and the public\,
  both of whom increasingly were affected by \nmachines\, cities\, and cr
 owds.\n\nIMAGE: William McGregor Paxton (U.S.A.\, 1869–1941)\, The Cryst

SUMMARY:Art Saves Ecology
UID:events_stanford_edu_79848
DESCRIPTION:\nFrom Ink Painting to Ecological Restoration: Zhu Renmin's S
 tudio and Land Art\n\nFrom the Chinese tradition of ink Shanshui paintin
 g to ecological restoration\, \nChinese artist Zhu Renmin embarked on a 
 crusade to save modern China’s \nlandscape over the past 3 decades\, by 
 applying his unique art-based approach. \nZhu puts his experience and ma
 stery of literature\, painting\, sculpture\, and \ncalligraphy at the se
 rvice of saving the environment\, cultural heritage and \nspiritual awar
 eness of our time. As Shanshui Ink Painting allows one to \nexperience l
 andscapes to find human's unity with nature\, Zhu turns to \narchitectur
 e and landscape design as an ultimate form to practice his art and \nphi
 losophy and made significant impact on the built environment and urban \
 nplanning in modern China\, completing nearly RMB 100 billion worth of \
 nrestoration projects. Zhu moved art out of the ivory tower so that the 
 public \nmay enjoy and use it. He brought traditional Chinese painting i
 nto the \ncontemporary period and expanded its use to design plans and a
 rchitectural \nprojects.\n\nAs a pioneer and early practitioner in the e
 co-landscape design field\, Zhu \nRenmin <https://www.artsecology.com/> 
 is the director of the Research Center \nfor Ecological Restoration at Z
 hejiang University. He was dean and research \ndirector of the Landscape
  and Architecture Design Institute at the China \nAcademy of Art in the 
 1990’s. Born in the coastal province of Zhejiang as the \ngrandson of Pa
 n Tianshou\, Zhu Renmin has won China’s highest awards for \nartistic ac
 hievement and international awards for green design. As a pioneer \nand 
 early practitioner in the eco-landscape design field\, in the 1980s Zhu 
 \nstarted to build the discipline of Human Ecological Restoration\, pion
 eering the \naesthetic concepts of “saving the environment through art” 
 and the theory of \n“spiritual\, natural\, and cultural ecologies.” For 
 over three decades\, Zhu has \ntoiled to rehabilitate the most forsaken 
 of landscapes destroyed by man: barren \nbeaches\, deserted islands\, de
 nuded cliffs\, polluted canals\, even the Yellow \nRiver.\n\nVISITOR INF

SUMMARY:Microbiome Symposium 2018
UID:events_stanford_edu_78341
DESCRIPTION:\nNow in its third year\, the purpose of the conference is to
  bring together \nleading minds looking to catalog the human microbiome 
 using modern genetics \ntools and especially those looking to apply new 
 computational technologies to \nsolve complicated problems in metagenomi
 cs to answer such questions such as:\n\n * How are changes in the microb
 iome associated with diseases in the \npopulation\, \n * How can you ide
 ntify novel microbes using sequence-based analysis\, \n * How can you im
 prove patient outcomes by characterizing microbiome dynamics\, \n * How 
 can you better understand host-microbiome symbiosis to be able to \nunde
 rstand and target microbial vulnerabilities\, \n * How can you track dyn
 amic microbiome shifts during disease\, etc. \n\nWhile genetics tools to
  characterize the human microbiome is no doubt \nimportant\, the goal of
  this conference is to focus on computational tools that \nhelp solve an
 y or all of the above complicated metagenomics problems.\n

SUMMARY:The System Transformation Masterclass: Scale and Leadership
UID:events_stanford_edu_79021
DESCRIPTION:\nThe "Leading with Systems Acupuncture" Masterclass will be 
 offered as two \nintegrated modules: \n(A) Designing the Scale Advantage
  & (B) Mastering Systems Leadership\n\nThe upcoming Masterclass “Leading
  with System Acupuncture”will give you the \nability to harness the elem
 ent of scale\, and lead teams through increasing \ncomplexity and rapid 
 change. In this two-module set:\n\n * “Designing the Scale Advantage” wi
 ll give you insights and principles for \nimparting scale deep in your s
 trategies and organizations. \n * “Mastering Systems Leadership” will eq
 uip you with new frameworks and \nmindsets that will give your organizat
 ion the capacity to reduce critical risks \nand unlock massive market op
 portunities in an era of increasing complexity. \n\n\n\nDesigning the Sc
 ale Advantage: September Mon 24 - Tue 25\n\nWhy do some businesses\, str
 ategies\, products\, initiatives\, never achieve \nscale? \n\nIn most ca
 ses\, it is because they were not designed with scale in their DNA. \nRa
 ther than leaving scale to a downstream phase\, our approach creates the
  \npre-conditions for scale\, and then bakes in the propensity for scale
  early in \nthe strategy phase.\nDesigning the Scale Advantage covers fr
 ameworks\, principles\, and mindsets for \ndesigning the scale advantage
  into your organizations\, leadership teams\, \nstrategies\, and initiat
 ives with ready tools to maximize your \norganization's ability to make 
 impact and unlock scaled opportunities. This \n2-day hands-on module foc
 uses on topics that help you develop scaling \nstrategies for your initi
 atives\, products\, and organization.\n\n\n\nMastering Systems Leadershi
 p: September Thu 27 - Fri 28\n\nWhat are the key capacities that a leade
 r needs so that their organization can \nthrive in the 21st century? \n\
 nSystems Leadership is a leadership capacity that circumvents the profou
 nd \nlimitations of the current leadership models that are simply not su
 ited for the \nincreasing complexity and change of our era. Leaders of t
 he 21st century need \nto have the confidence and capacity to navigate t
 heir organizations and teams \nthrough increasingly dynamic\, complex\, 
 and rapidly changing challenges. Not \nplaying the systems game creates 
 a massive risk on two fronts (a) a risk of \nbeing disrupted or made irr
 elevant\, and (b) the risk of not spotting massive \nopportunities for s
 ystem change and market creation. Thus\, two key capacities \nthat leade
 rs of the 21st century need are:\n\n * to respond to rapidly changing fu
 tures\, and \n * to envision a desired future and innovate practical yet
  transformative \npathways towards achieving it. \n\nMastering Systems L
 eadership covers key mindsets and tools that an avant-garde \nleader nee
 d to navigate complex systems to arrive at leveraged intervention \ndesi
 gns while building an ecosystem that fosters agility and innovation.\n

SUMMARY:Videographic Frankenstein
UID:events_stanford_edu_79400
DESCRIPTION:\nAn Exhibition of Creative and Scholarly Video\nCurated by S
 hane Denson\, Assistant Professor of Film & Media Studies\n\nCommemorati
 ng the 200th anniversary of the publication of Mary \nShelley’s Frankens
 tein in 1818\, Videographic Frankenstein reflects on the \nnovel’s visua
 l legacy across more than a century of adaptation in \nfilm\, television
 \, and other media. The exhibition foregrounds scholarly and \ncreative 
 work that utilizes digital video for a self-reflexive analysis of \nmovi
 ng-image media. This self-reflexive methodology is particularly appropri
 ate \nfor the study of Frankenstein and its many cinematic adaptations: 
 the cinema \nitself works by stitching together “dead” photographic trac
 es of the past to \n“animate” its hybrid compositions\, and it can there
 fore be regarded as a \n“Frankensteinian” technology in its own right. \
 n\nThe many Frankenstein films produced over the past century – from Tho
 mas \nEdison’s silent Frankenstein (1910) to digitally enhanced CGI spec
 tacles \nlike I\, Frankenstein (2014) – offer an important register of t
 he \nhistorically contingent relations between humans and their technolo
 gies\, \nincluding the relation of spectators to the cinematic apparatus
 . Videographic \nexplorations of this rich archive thus provide an excep
 tional opportunity to \nthink about our evolving relations to technology
 \, including media technologies\, \nwhile contributing to and helping to
  shape an emerging field of scholarly \nand creative media practice.\n\n

SUMMARY:Geophysics Department Seminar - Aurélien Mordret: Exploring the G

UID:events_stanford_edu_78779
DESCRIPTION:\nAmbient seismic noise methods have been around for more tha
 n a decade now but \nthey have not run out of applications yet. Both ima
 ging and temporal monitoring \nof seismic velocities techniques bring in
 valuable information on the structure \nand dynamic of the Earth crust a
 nd some environmental phenomena affecting it.\n\nThis is particularly tr
 ue for remote and seismically quiet areas such as \nGreenland. I will pr
 esent two studies of the Greenland crust using ambient \nnoise correlati
 on methods. In the first one\, I monitored the Greenland \nice-sheet sea
 sonal mass variations by measuring the loading-induced \npore-pressure v
 ariations in the crust as seen through the prism of shear-wave \nspeed t
 emporal fluctuations. In the second study\, I used the Rayleigh waves \n
 contained in the noise correlations computed between each pair of sensor
 s from \nthe GLISN seismic network to image the crustal and uppermost ma
 ntle structures \nassociated with the Iceland hotspot track beneath Gree
 nland. I observed high \nvelocity anomalies linked to magmatic intrusion
 s in the middle crust and a \nremnant low velocity/High temperature/low 
 viscosity anomalies in the upper \nmantle at the location where the Icel
 and hotspot was the most active 60 Ma ago.\n

SUMMARY:No Belles: Legends of Women in Science
UID:events_stanford_edu_80102
DESCRIPTION:\n"No Belles" is a performance of the stories of women scient
 ists who have and \nhave not received the Nobel Prize. A significant dis
 parity in our society is \nthe number of women pursuing careers in STEM.
  An oft-cited reason for this \nimbalance is the lack of good role model
 s.  The Portal Theatre group's "No \nBelles" makes visible the significa
 nt contributions of women in science and \nserves as a powerful catalyst
  for increased interactions between the sciences \nand the community.  N
 otably\, a performance of “No Belles” was hosted by the ACS \nin 2017 at
  the Fall National meeting as an adjunct to a symposium on the \nunderre
 presentation of women in chemistry.  It is outlined inCE&N’s Sept 11 201

SUMMARY:Freedom Behind Bars: Indira Gandhi's Emergency Regime\,1975-77.
UID:events_stanford_edu_79890
DESCRIPTION:\nGyan Prakash is the Dayton-Stockton Professor of History at
  Princeton \nUniversity and specializes in South Asian history\, colonia
 l and postcolonial \nstudies\, and urban history. He was a member of the
  Subaltern Studies Collective \nuntil its dissolution in 2006\, and has 
 been a recipient of fellowships by the \nNational Science Foundation\, t
 he Guggenheim Foundation\, and the National \nEndowment of Humanities. H
 e is the author of several books\, including Mumbai \nFables (2010)\, wh
 ich was adapted for the film Bombay Velvet (2015)\, for which \nhe wrote
  the story and co-wrote the script. His forthcoming book is Emergency \n
 Chronicles\, which will be published in early 2019.\n\nOn the night of J
 une 25\, 1975\, Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in \nIndia\,
  suspending constitutional rights and rounding up her political opponent
 s \nin midnight raids across the country. In the twenty-one harrowing mo
 nths that \nfollowed\, her regime unleashed a brutal campaign of coercio
 n and intimidation\, \narresting and torturing people by the tens of tho
 usands\, razing slums\, and \nimposing compulsory sterilization on the p
 oor. In spite of this searing \nexperience\, the Emergency has received 
 little historical treatment. Stripping \naway the comfortable myth that 
 this authoritarian turn was a momentary episode \nbrought on entirely by
  Indira's crisis of power\, this paper argues that the \npolitical crisi
 s in India formed part of a larger global moment during the late \n1960s
  and the early 1970s when ruling regimes around the world faced upheaval
 s \nfrom below. Indira attempted to deal with the challenge to her power
 \, and \nsought to salvage the postcolonial order\, by suppressing const
 itutional rights. \nThis paper examines the meanings of democracy raised
  by the political turmoil. \nDrawing on prison diaries and letters\, it 
 asks how the imprisoned leaders \nthought about democracy and the phenom
 enology of the loss of freedom behind \nbars. Did introspection produce 
 a greater dedication to the more profound \nunderstanding of democracy a
 nd the value of equality\, or did their writings and \nthoughts on freed
 om stop at the door of competitive party politics? These \nquestions are
  important for not only understanding the experience of \nimprisonment d
 uring the Emergency but also for what they imply for the period \nthat f
 ollowed.\n

SUMMARY:OPENING RECEPTION | Wherein Waters Rise\, Drought Advances and Mi
 gration of Species Becomes Inevitable
UID:events_stanford_edu_80228
DESCRIPTION:\nThe Stanford Department of Art and Art History presents Whe
 rein Waters Rise\, \nDrought Advances and Migration of Species Becomes I
 nevitable. Artists Helen and \nNewton Harrison respond to climate change
  at three scales:The Bays at San \nFrancisco\, Green House Britain\, and
  Peninsula Europe IV.\n\nHelen and Newton Harrison\, whose archives were
  recently acquired by Stanford \nUniversity\, have been addressing the c
 hanging climate and its powerful impacts \non culture since the early 19
 70s. Their artwork is speculative in nature\, but \ngrounded in their co
 llaborations with scientists\, architects\, engineers\, and \npolitician
 s. Three projects – at the scale of the city\, island nation\, and \ncon
 tinent – are part of the Harrison’s view on the urgency of this moment. 
 \nTheir view that this dramatic shift will happen with or without our ec
 ological \nintelligence and empathy is dire in its predictions\, but ult
 imately optimistic \nin the proposition that we can assist in the reorga
 nization of human activity \nat the scale of the problem\, assisting the
  inevitable migration of species\, \nincluding ourselves. With massive s
 torm damage occurring globally and drought \nthreatening migration at an
  unprecedented magnitude\, this is a timely moment to \nmount this exhib
 ition.\n\nThe Bays at San Francisco looks ahead to the 100-year horizon 
 and imagines \nwhat the water rising\, potentially as much as a meter or
  more\, will do to the \necology and infrastructure of the regional wate
 rshed system as salt water \nbegins to reclaim land up into the Central 
 Valley. Green House Britain examines \nthe near future as rising sea lev
 els literally redraw the map of the Island of \nBritain. It poses crucia
 l questions around choices to defend what exists or to \nwithdraw to hig
 her ground\, while proposing new ways to think about what they \ncalleco
 -civilty in the coming age of mass migration. Peninsula Europe IV \ncons
 iders the coming drought over the next several decades and potential \ni
 mpacts on the continent of Europe\, challenging current ideas of border 
 and \nculture\, and offering new social\, political and economic boundar
 ies based \nalternative forms of land use.\n\nOpening at the Coulter Gal
 lery (in the McMurtry Building) on October 23\, 2018. \nA reception with
  Newton Harrison in attendance will take place October 25 at 4 \np.m.\n\
 nAbout the Artists: Pioneers of the eco-art movement\, Helen Mayer Harri
 son (who \ndied on March 24\, 2018) and Newton Harrison’s work has often
  involved \nco-collaborators such as biologists\, ecologists\, urban pla
 nners\, and local \ncitizens to support biodiversity and community devel
 opment around the world. \nThe Harrisons’ work explores the relationship
  between words and images through \nthe use of maps\, drawings\, paintin
 gs\, photomurals\, and collages with a \nstorytelling/performance compon
 ent. Ecological concerns\, survival\, watershed \nrestoration\, urban re
 newal\, agriculture\, forestry\, and other environmental \nissues have r
 emained the focal point of their work over the decades. Their \nvisionar
 y projects have at times led to governmental policy changes\, as well as
  \ncreating and expanding dialogue between groups with diverging interes

DESCRIPTION:\nEdward Simpson is a Social Anthropologist and Director of t

 interested in the \nrelationship between infrastructure\, automobility a

 The political biography of an \nearthquake: Aftermath and amnesia in Guj
 arat India (Hurst 2013). He is the \nPrincipal Investigator on a five-ye
 ar project funded by the European Research \nCouncil looking at infrastr
 ucture across South Asia. This work is being \nundertaken in partnership
  with the Mumbai-based artists CAMP.\n\nThis talk follows the route of S
 tate Highway 31 through western Madhya \nPradesh\, central India. The re
 search was part of a larger project looking at \nthe ideas behind the pr
 oduction of infrastructure in South Asia. This journey \ntakes us throug
 h landscapes of sex work and opium\, some of the oldest \nnationalist ne
 tworks in the country\, and along the fault-lines of long-running \ntens
 ions between local communities. The road was one of a series built as a 
 \npublic private partnership and\, as such\, speaks of the reconfigurati
 on of state \nrelations with private capital and business. Toll booths b
 ecome places of \ncompany ethos\, education and for the creation of new 
 kinds of citizens. The \nnexus of government and private enterprise take
 s us on a dizzying journey \nthrough the world’s tax havens and onto the
  decks of luxury yachts. Exploring \nthe broader political economy of th
 e road and the organisation of institutions \nand travellers that sustai
 n it encourages questions about the nature of \ngovernance and power in

SUMMARY:Film Screening | The Voice of Hagia Sophia
UID:events_stanford_edu_79342
DESCRIPTION:\nDocumentary film\, 24 minutes\, 2018\n\nAn acoustic and vis
 ual exploration of the 1500-year-old Hagia Sophia in \nIstabul (Turkey)\
 , built by emperor Justinian in the sixth century and \nrecognized as th
 e largest domed interior in the Mediterranean before the \nRenaissance r
 ebuilding of St. Peter’s. For centuries\, resonant voice and \nbounded l
 ight worked together in this magnificent interior to evoke the divine. \
 nToday as a museum\, the function of the space has changed and no singin
 g is \nallowed inside. Stanford’s interdisciplinary project “Icons of So
 und” \n(2008-present)\, directed by Bissera Pentcheva (Art History) and 
 Jonathan Abel \n(Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics) an
 d in collaboration with \nthe foremost choir for Byzantine chant in Nort
 h America\, Cappella Romana\, have \nrevived Hagia Sophia’s soundscape. 
 Using digital technology\, the team has \nsuccessfully imprinted the aco
 ustic signature of that space on live sound and \nproduced two major con
 certs at Stanford's Bing Hall. This documentary records \nthe innovative
  research of “Icons of Sound” that bridges technology with \nhumanties a
 nd shows how the insights gained have deepened our understanding of \nHa
 gia Sophia’s complex history. This is particularly exigent in the curren
 t \nmoment when this UNESCO World Monument is threatened to be converted
  back into \na mosque and the traces of its Christian legacy––wiped out.

SUMMARY:Japonica Brown-Saracino\, How Places Make Us: The Origins of Nove
 l LBQ Identities in Four Small Cities. 
UID:events_stanford_edu_79227
DESCRIPTION:\nWe like to think of ourselves as possessing an essential se
 lf\, a core identity \nthat is who we really are\, regardless of where w
 e live or work. But\, drawing on \nan extensive ethnographic study of le
 sbian\, bisexual\, and queer individuals in \nfour small cities\, Brown-
 Saracino's lecture will reveal that places make us \nmuch more than we t
 hink.  Taking us into Ithaca\, New York\; San Luis Obispo\, \nCalifornia
 \; Greenfield\, Massachusetts\; and Portland\, Maine\; the lecture will 
 \ndemonstrate that LBQ migrants craft a unique sense of self that corres
 ponds to \ntheir new homes.  Despite the fact that the LBQ residents sha
 re many \ndemographic and cultural traits\, their approaches to sexual i
 dentity politics \nand to ties with other LBQ individuals and heterosexu
 al residents vary markedly \nby where they live. Subtly distinct city ec
 ologies shape what it feels like to \nbe a sexual minority and how one “
 does” LBQ in a specific place\; there isn’t \none general way of approac
 hing sexual identity because humans are not only \nsocial but fundamenta
 lly local creatures. The study calls us away from strictly \ntemporal an
 d demographic explanations for identity formation\, as well as from a \n
 spatial map that only recognizes variation across red and blue states\, 
 rural \nand urban locales\, and coastal and inland cities.  Interactions
  and \nself-understanding respond to even very subtle differences in cit
 y conditions\, \ncreating city-specific identities and communities. \n\n
 Japonica Brown-Saracino is Associate Professor of Sociology at Boston \n
 University.  She is the author of A Neighborhood That Never Changes: \nG
 entrification\, Social Preservation and the Search for Authenticity (Uni
 versity \nof Chicago 2009)\, which received the Urban Affairs Associatio
 n Best Book \nAward\, and How Places Make Us: Novel LBQ Identities in Fo
 ur Small Cities \n(University of Chicago 2017).  She is editor ofThe Gen
 trification Debates \n(Routledge 2010)\, and her articles on urban chang
 e\, culture\, identity\, and city \necology have appeared in journals su

 erritories called Edge States―altruism\, \nempathy\, integrity\, respect

 this way\, these five psychological experiences form edges\, \nand it is
  only when we stand at these edges that we become open to the full \nran
